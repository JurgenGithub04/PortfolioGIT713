                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Web mapping has become an essential part of modern-day technology. It allows users to view and analyze geographic data in a digital format. In my recent project, I had the opportunity to create a web map prototype for the Stellenbosch University botanical garden using the Leaflet library. This page reflects on what I learned during this project, including the technical skills I developed, the challenges I faced, and the reward of creating a fully functional web map prototype.</p>

            <h2>Learning Leaflet Library</h2><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1510602617700950021/K4IoVubu_400x400.jpg" alt="leaflet">
            <p>As a first-time user of the Leaflet library, I had to familiarize myself with the various functions and features. Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library used for creating mobile-friendly interactive maps. I learned how to add and switch between different base layers, filter between different layers and add them in a separate section where they can be toggled on and off, and play around with different zoom levels.</p>

            <h2>Adding Search Functionality</h2><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ernA4brJJ_7R9fJ8um7RPtTEaWE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ipad-zoom-581753925f9b581c0b12ec19.png" alt="Search">
            <p>One of the features I added to the web map prototype was a search controller that allows users to type in a species name to find information about that plant. I also added a click event listener on the points that represent the species, allowing users to click on the points and obtain more information about them.</p>

            <h2>Improving My Web Development Skills</h2><img src="https://familycomputercentre.com/wp-content/uploads/logo-web-development.jpg" alt="Search">
            <p>While building this web map prototype, I improved my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This project pushed me to learn more about working with geojson and json files. I also figured out geolocation and used the HTML5 geolocation API to get the location of the user in the garden. The project challenged me to think creatively and solve problems related to displaying geographic data in a user-friendly manner.</p>

            <h2>Filtering Functionality</h2><img src="https://www.bounteous.com/sites/default/files/insights/2020-02/previews/20200220_blog_.identifying-and-filtering-internal-traffic-from-google-analytics_website.png" alt="filter">
            <p>Filtering is an essential feature for any web map, as it allows users to quickly and easily identify and display the information they are interested in. In my web map prototype, I implemented a filtering functionality that enables users to toggle different layers on and off. I achieved this by using Leaflet's layer control, which allows users to switch between different base layers and overlay layers.</p>
            <p>In my web map, I added several overlay layers, each representing a different species of plant in the botanical garden. By using the layer control, users can easily toggle between these different layers, depending on which plant they want to view. This makes it much easier for users to identify the location of specific plants in the garden, and to obtain more detailed information about them.</p>
            <p>Implementing this filtering functionality was a significant challenge, but one that I found extremely rewarding. It required me to work closely with geoJSON and JSON files, and to develop a deep understanding of Leaflet's API. However, by persevering and pushing myself to learn new things, I was able to create a web map prototype that I am proud of, and that has the potential to be a valuable resource for visitors to the botanical garden.</p>

            <h2>Zooming</h2><img src="https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/0/3/1/6/136130-1-eng-GB/Zooming-in-on-protein-trends.jpg" alt="Zoom">
            <p>In the process of creating a leaflet map, I implemented a zoom feature that selectively displays items at different zoom levels. This feature was designed to improve the user experience by reducing clutter and allowing users to focus on the most relevant information at each zoom level.</p>
            <p>To achieve this, I carefully analyzed the data and identified the key information that needed to be displayed at each zoom level. I then coded the map to automatically hide or reveal items based on the user's zoom level, ensuring that the map remained visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p>
            <p>The results of this implementation were impressive. The map became more user-friendly and engaging, allowing users to explore and analyze the data at their own pace. By selectively displaying information at each zoom level, users were able to better understand the geographic context of the data and draw more informed conclusions.</p>
            <p>In reflection, I believe that this implementation was successful because it was designed with the user in mind. By prioritizing usability and functionality, I was able to create a map that is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. This experience has taught me the importance of user-centered design and the power of thoughtful implementation.</p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>Building this web map prototype was a rewarding experience. It taught me how to use a new library of JavaScript and expand my website and web map coding abilities. It was challenging at times, but I was able to overcome obstacles and produce a functional and useful web map. Overall, the project taught me valuable skills in web mapping, including how to work with geographic data, how to code interactive maps, and how to incorporate user-friendly features like search controllers and geolocation.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, my experience building a web map prototype using the Leaflet library was an exciting and educational journey. I learned new technical skills, faced challenges, and enjoyed the reward of creating a functional and interactive web map. Building this project has made me appreciate the power and potential of web mapping, and I look forward to exploring more opportunities to expand my skills in this area.</p>
