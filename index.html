          <h2>Welcome to my portfolio for the GIT 713 module!</h2>
          <p>My name is Jurgen Koegelenberg, and I am a GeoInformatics honours student at Stellenbosch University.</p>
        <p>In this module, we have focused on GIS professionalism, ethics, legislation, strategy, implementation, data management, and quality, covering topics such as geodesy, PGIS, data wrangling, project management, and software development management.</p>
        <p>Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my knowledge and skills in GIS strategy and implementation, as well as data collection and map development. I have also learned the importance of connecting with clients in GIS projects and delivering web map prototypes.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing sports and expanding my knowledge and skills through learning new things. Originally from George in the Western Cape, I attended Outeniqua High School before pursuing my undergraduate degree in GeoInformatics, which I completed in 2022.</p>
        <p>I hope this introduction gives a glimpse into my interests, skills, and experience in GIS and demonstrates my passion for lifelong learning.</p>

          <h2>Mind Map of what I have learned in GIT 713</h2>
        <img id = "mindmap" src="Mind map.png" alt="Mind Map">
        <div >
          <p id = "mindMap">These topics are all related to one another in various ways. Geodesy (Shape of the Earth) is essential for understanding the spatial relationships of the Earth's surface and thus is related to GIS Strategy and Implementation, which builds upon this foundation. Effective communication is crucial for the successful implementation of GIS systems, making Business communication also related to GIS Strategy and Implementation. GIT professionalism and ethics and Legislation both deal with the ethical and legal implications of using geospatial information, which makes them closely related to each other. Project and Software Development Planning and Management and Databases are related to GIS Strategy and Implementation since they all deal with the practical aspects of implementing GIS systems, including managing and analyzing geospatial data. Metadata is crucial for organizing and managing geospatial data, making it related to GIS Strategy and Implementation as well. Social GIS and data access and Data Management both focus on making geospatial information accessible to a wide range of users, linking the two topics. Lastly, uncertainty is important to understand and account for when analyzing geospatial data, making it related to GIS Strategy and Implementation.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Skills and Knowledge</h2>
        <p class="section-text">My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in geospatial technology, spatial data analysis, and GIS software tools. I have experience working with industry-standard GIS software packages such as ArcGIS, QGIS, and PCI Geomatica, as well as programming languages such as Python and R for GIS data analysis, visualization, and automation.</p>
        <p class="section-text">As part of my academic pursuits, I have also gained experience in GIS strategy and implementation, including geodesy, PGIS, project management, and software development management. I have learned the importance of managing GIS projects effectively, from planning and scoping to implementing and delivering web map prototypes. I have also gained experience in data management, including data wrangling, data quality control, and data sharing.</p>
        <p class="section-text">My coursework has also emphasized the importance of professional ethics, legislation, and quality assurance in GIS projects. I understand the significance of adhering to ethical and legal guidelines in GIS data collection and management, and I have learned how to ensure the quality of GIS data through data validation and quality control procedures.</p>
        <p class="section-text">In addition to my academic skills, I possess strong communication and teamwork skills. I understand the importance of communicating with clients and stakeholders in GIS projects to ensure that project goals are met and expectations are managed effectively. I also understand the importance of working collaboratively with team members to ensure that GIS projects are completed on time, within budget, and to a high standard of quality.</p>
        <p class="section-text">Overall, my skills and knowledge in GeoInformatics, GIS strategy and implementation, and data collection and map development make me a strong candidate for GIS-related roles in various industries.</p>

      <h2>Personal Background</h2>
      <p>I grew up in George, a beautiful city in the Western Cape of South Africa. After completing my secondary education at Outeniqua High School, I pursued my undergraduate degree in GeoInformatics at Stellenbosch University. The program provided me with a solid foundation in geospatial technology and GIS software tools.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am continuing my academic journey by pursuing an honours degree in GeoInformatics. The program has allowed me to deepen my knowledge and skills in GIS strategy and implementation, data collection, and map development.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors, especially at the beach and hiking trails. I also have a passion for sports, particularly cricket, golf, football, hockey, rugby, and tennis. I believe that staying active and engaging in sports is not only good for physical health but also for mental wellbeing.</p>
