            <h2>What Is Gis Strategy</h2> <img src="https://www.gptglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DataFussCycle-1.png" alt="Strategy">
            <p>The use of GIS technology has become widespread due to user-friendly interfaces, decreasing costs, and increasing capabilities. Organizations face two sets of challenges regarding GIS technology: bringing it into organizations where it is not yet implemented, and issues arising from recent developments that impact organizations where GIS is already implemented. Failing to plan for the implementation of GIS technology can result in incomplete or improper GIS design, which is a common cause of system failures. Planning should have a long-term view and be ongoing to accommodate changes in needs, situation, and data availability. A critical step in any strategy plan is to identify human or social factors that may limit uptake and include these in the design and implementation plan. Implementation of GIS technology is a change process that requires enthusiasm for change for it to be successful. It is necessary to consider others and be sensitive to the variety of needs within the organization while designing, implementing, or running a GIS. The key considerations for GIS strategy are centralized vs decentralized, in-house/custom-built vs off-the-shelf product, how complex or specialized the system should be, how big a system to start with, and what geographical area it should cover. The most clearly described approaches to planning or developing new GIS systems are linear or structured. However, linear approaches may result in a system that does not meet the user's needs due to a lack of organizational learning.</p>

            <h2>GIS Strategy Implementation</h2>
            <p>In GIS project management, the linear approach involves following a strict sequence of steps from planning to implementation. The process approach, on the other hand, acknowledges that steps don't have to occur strictly in order and can be repeated or even skipped as necessary. A mixed approach blends the two and allows for some flexibility in the project's workflow.</p>
            <p>Our project was to create a prototype webmap for Don Kirkwood, the curator at Stellenbosch University, to upgrade the existing one. We applied a mixed linear and process approach to project management to deliver a high-quality product to the client.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly defined goals</li>
                    <ul><li >Our primary goal was to create a dynamic webmap prototype that allows Don to add new species and themes. We also aimed to improve data security and create a database that can be automatically converted to a new geojson file.</li></ul>
                <li>Clearly defined strategic purpose of the GIS</li>
                    <ul><li >Our purpose was to provide Don with an updated database that can be easily updated and linked to the webmap prototype.</li></ul>
                <li>Plan to plan</li>
                    <ul><li >We created a comprehensive project plan that included a conceptual design, logical design, and physical instance. We presented the conceptual design to Don during our third meeting, where we discussed the software we would use and why. The logical design had diagrams that depicted the flow of data accurately, and the physical instance had core functionalities demonstrated. The final delivery had all the core functionalities Don expected.</li></ul>
                <li>Identify points during planning, development, and implementation.</li>
                     <ul><li >We met with Don five times to discuss the project's progress and ensure his needs were being met. We also engaged with the lecturers of GIT 713 to ensure that they were satisfied with the project's progress.</li></ul>
                <li>Identify key role-players and champions</li>
                    <ul><li >We identified Don Kirkwood as the key stakeholder in the project and engaged with him regularly to ensure that his needs were being met. We also worked closely with our team members to ensure that all project objectives were met.</li></ul>
                <li>Determine the end products</li>
                    <ul><li >Our project deliverables included logical designs, physical instances, and conceptual models. We delivered a web map and a secure database that can be automatically added onto the leaflet map.</li></ul>
                <li>Determine the system scope</li>
                    <ul><li >We defined the system's scope and boundaries to ensure that the webmap would operate within them. This helped us determine what data to include and how to design the system.</li></ul>
                <li>Data design</li>
                    <ul><li >We developed a plan for database design to ensure that the webmap worked effectively. This involved organizing the data and including the necessary information in the system. We also had to ensure that the database allows the user to apply more than one theme  to a species.</li></ul>
                <li>Apply project management techniques</li> <img id = "img2" src="https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/strategic-planning.jpeg" alt="planning">
                    <ul><li >We used project management techniques, such as Gantt charts, to help us manage the project effectively. This enabled us to track progress against the project plan and identify any issues that needed to be addressed.</li></ul>
                <li>Regular meetings</li>
                    <ul><li >We held regular meetings with our team to discuss progress and identify any issues that needed to be addressed. This helped us to ensure that the project stayed on track and that all team members were working together effectively.</li></ul>

            <h2>Reflection on GIS Strategy</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about GIS strategy, which is critical for organizations to bring this technology into their operations successfully. The implementation of GIS technology requires careful planning and ongoing assessment of its effectiveness to ensure it meets the organization's needs and goals. This involves identifying human or social factors that could limit its uptake and incorporating them into the design and implementation plan.</p>
            <p>There are several key considerations for GIS strategy, including whether the system will be centralized or decentralized, whether it will be an in-house/custom-built or off-the-shelf product, how complex or specialized the system should be, how big a system to start with, and what geographical area it should cover. Organizations must carefully weigh these factors and determine the most appropriate approach to developing their GIS systems.</p>
            <p>I also learned about different approaches to GIS project management, including the linear, process, and mixed approaches. A mixed approach allows for some flexibility in the project's workflow, blending the linear and process approaches to ensure that the project stays on track while also allowing for necessary adjustments.</p>
            <p>I gained practical knowledge of GIS strategy by applying a mixed linear and process approach to create a prototype webmap for a client. I learned the importance of setting clear goals and objectives, engaging with stakeholders throughout the project, developing a comprehensive project plan, and using project management techniques to monitor progress and identify and address issues. Overall, this task gave me a better understanding of the critical factors to consider when planning and implementing GIS technology within an organization.</p>
