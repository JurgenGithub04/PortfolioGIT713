            <h2>Software Development Management</h2>
            <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="GitHub Logo">
            <p>Software development management is a continuous process of planning, organizing, updating, and testing new versions of a software product. This process requires collaboration and coordination between various departments and teams to ensure that the final product meets the necessary requirements.</p>

			<h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
			<p>Version control systems such as Git, GitHub, and Gitea are tools that facilitate remote version control and allow multiple team members to work on a product simultaneously. These tools use a 'push/pull' system to manage input and output, making it easier to track changes and collaborate on projects with different teams.</p>

            <h2>Agile Methodology - SCRUM</h2>
            <p>Another key concept in software development is the agile methodology of SCRUM, which promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, and continuous improvement within the project. SCRUM involves short bursts of work called 'sprints' that aim to create shippable products that can be reviewed and improved upon in subsequent sprints. By using SCRUM, teams can work more effectively and efficiently while still producing high-quality products.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, my reflection on these concepts is that they are essential for any software development project. Understanding version control and software development management will help teams work collaboratively and efficiently to produce scalable, maintainable, and transferable code. By utilizing tools such as Git and adopting agile methodologies like SCRUM, teams can create successful software products while still meeting tight deadlines and client requirements.</p>
