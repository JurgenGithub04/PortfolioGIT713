<p>During this task, I had the opportunity to watch a lecture presented by Aslam Parker, the Chief Director of National Geospatial Information, and review a memo from one of my classmates. Through these activities, I gained a deeper understanding of various geospatial topics that are essential for analyzing and mapping geospatial data accurately. </p>

<p>One of the things that stood out to me was the importance of understanding the approximations of the shape of the earth. I learned that the earth is an oblate spheroid and that this knowledge is crucial for accurate mapping and geospatial data analysis. Additionally, I gained knowledge on geocentric cartesian and geographic coordinates and how they are used to position points on the earth's surface.<img src="https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/getsi/geodesy/gravity_map_earth.jpg_crops/5420a06419a937408009637cb8631018.jpg" alt="Geodesy"></p>

<p>I also learned about projected coordinates and map projections and the various types of projections available. I realized that each map projection has its advantages and disadvantages, and understanding them is crucial for accurate mapping. Moreover, I delved into geodetic datums/reference frames, which are standards used to describe the shape and size of the earth.</p>

<p>In the South African Coordinate Reference System section, I learned about the different categories of coordinate reference systems, including projected coordinate systems and geographic coordinate systems. Through this, I gained knowledge of the coordinate systems, geodetic datums, and map projections used in South Africa.</p>

<p>To solidify my knowledge, I created a paper with questions and rubrics that challenged my understanding of each section. The questions included comprehension of concepts such as the oblate spheroid shape of the earth, latitude and longitude, cartesian coordinates, map projections, geodetic datums, and CRS categories.</p>

<p>Reviewing my classmate's memo was a valuable learning experience. It allowed me to expand my knowledge and gain a better understanding of the geospatial concepts covered in the lecture.</p>

<p>Through the review, I was able to think critically about the concepts and evaluate my own understanding of them. I was able to identify areas where I needed more clarification and ask questions that helped me gain a better understanding of the topics.</p>

<p>Moreover, reviewing my classmate's memo provided me with the opportunity to practice thinking in terms of a reviewer. I was able to provide constructive feedback that helped my classmate improve their work, while also reflecting on my own work and identifying areas where I could improve.</p>

<p>Through watching the lecture and reviewing my classmate's memo, I have gained a deeper understanding of geospatial concepts such as the approximations of the shape of the earth, geocentric cartesian and geographic coordinates, projected coordinates and map projections, geodetic datums/reference frames, and the South African Coordinate Reference System. Additionally, I have developed skills such as critical thinking, reviewing, and providing constructive feedback, which will be beneficial in my future learning experiences. With this knowledge and skillset, I am better equipped to analyze and map geospatial data accurately. Overall, this learning experience has been incredibly valuable and enjoyable, and has provided me with a strong foundation in geospatial concepts that has inspired me to continue exploring this field.</p>
